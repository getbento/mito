{# ============================================================================
================== TRACKING ===================================================
============================================================================= #}
{#
	Creates a hidden tracking element to be included in a form. In JavaScript, 
	each form will look for this tag inside itself, and if it exists, it will 
	configure, listen for, and track the appropriate events in GA.

	Please note, most forms are being tracked via tracking API calls directly 
	from the corresponding JavaScript callbacks in main.js, ticketing.js, etc. 
	Those forms SHOULD NOT use this macro for tracking. This macro is only 
	intended to be used on forms that do not utilize JavaScript/Ajax, and 
	therefore, do not provide a method of hooking into forms current callback
	methods.

	Please note, at this time only event="submit" is supported, and only one 
	event="submit" per form is supported. Also, on forms that do not open in 
	new windows and do not use any JavaScript/Ajax, currently, it is possible 
	that the tracking tag does not get sent before the page redirects. We are
	working on a potential solution to the issue.
	
	@access public
	@param {String} event 			- Event we should be tracking so JS is configured properly.
	@param {String} category 		- The GA category assigned to the event.
	@param {String} action 			- The GA action assigned to the event.
	@param {String} label 			- The GA label assigned to the event. (Optional)
	@param {String} tag 			- The html tag to assign to the DOM node.
	@returns {HTML}

{#
	Tracks various phone number buttons per "placement" on a page. For example, phone numbers in 
	the desktop header should track separately than a button in the mobile footer. This macro is 
	called from a few different places and different files, so this "shortcut" is provided to 
	ensure the category naming is consisten and typo-free – internally calling the button() macro.
	
	@access public
	@param {String} placement 		- The GA label assigned to the event. Should represent the button's placement on the page.
